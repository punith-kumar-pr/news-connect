This is a fullstack MERN web application that allows users to search for and save articles based on a query.

![NYT-Scraper](/README/readme.gif)

## Getting Started :city_sunset:
 [The application is deployed on heroku here](https://scraper-nyt-react.herokuapp.com/)

You can open up the deployed link and explore the website. Enter a search query along with the time range you'd like to search for articles from. You'll get the most recent responses from the New York Times.

You can store interesting articles to look at later and then remove them from the saved list.

### Prerequisites :open_file_folder:
You will need both `node` and `yarn` installed on your computer in order to run this app. You can find out more about `yarn` at their [official site.](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

### Installation :file_folder:
Inside your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the location of the cloned repo. Install the necessary dependencies by running either - 
```
npm i
```
or
```
yarn install
```
after the dependencies have been installed, you will need to make sure you have mongoDB configured on your computer as outlined in the next section.

If you already have mongoDB setup, you can run
```
yarn start
```
to intialize the app. It will launch the application at `http://localhost:3000` and you are now ready to search for random New York Times articles

### mongoDB :herb:
In order for the app to render locally, you will need to have mongoDB installed on your computer. Depending on your operating system, the installation proccess will be different. You can find more info on installing mongoDB through their documentation.
